RefET
-----
Outputs from the RefET module include daily or hourly reference ET (grass and alfalfa) calculated following the approach in ASCE-EWRI  `(2005) <https://ascelibrary.org/doi/book/10.1061/9780784408056>`_. 

**Timeseries Data**

CropETPrep
----------
The CropET Prep workflow is designed to build input files for the Crop ET module based on user specified files and needs. Many of the prepration scripts are helper functions to download and calculate zonal statistic information for the study area of interest. The preperation workflow requires users to set-up an intial study domain shapefile. The Crop ET module of ETDemands utilizes project specific static files for input and does not rely on .shp generated throughout the preparation workflow. It is recommended to build study area shpaefile and utilize the prepration workflow. Only advanced users should manually modify static files.

The descriptions below give a brief overview of the output from each preperation workflow script:

:download_cdl_raster.py: Downloads CONUS wide Crop Data Layer (CDL) raster for study crop identifcation and acreage estimates
:clip_cdl_raster.py:  Generates study area clipped version of CDL raster
:build_ag_cdl_shapefile.py: Build CDL shapefile for agricultural crop pixels only
:download_statsgo_shapefiles.py: Download statsgo soil available water capacity (AWC), Clay and Sand shapefiles
:et_demands_zonal_stats.py: Calculates zonal statistics needed to run Crop ET module
:build_static_files.py: Builds static files for Crop ET analysis

Optional (Spatially Varying Calibration Scripts):

:build_spatial_crop_params.py: Builds spatial parameter shapefiles for ET-Demands
:interpolate_spatial_crop_params.py: Interpolate spatial parameter files for ET-Demands (modifies spatial parameter shapefiles)

CropET
------

ETDemands is capable of outputting both raw daily files as well as monthly, annual, and growing season summary files. All model output files are saved in .csv format. Model output files are controlled by the stat flags and folder names in the [CROP_ET] section of the model .ini file. Output files are enabled by setting the specific stat_flag = True.

- Stats flags
  
	+ daily_stats_flag = True
    
    	+ monthly_stats_flag = False
    
    	+ annual_stats_flag = False
    
    	+ growing_season_stats_flag = False


Statistic subfolders are created for each of the enabled stat flags above and will be located in the Project Folder

- ET sub-folder names

	+ daily_output_folder = daily_stats
    
    	+ monthly_output_folder = monthly_stats
    
    	+ annual_output_folder = annual_stats
    
    	+ gs_output_folder = growing_season_stats


In addition to date information, each stat file contains the following results:

:PMeto/PMetr: Input reference evapotranspiration (ET)
:ETact: Actual Crop ET including stress adjustments
:ETpot: Crop Specific Potential ET 
:ETbas: Basal evaporation component of ET
:Kc:  Crop Coefficient  
:Kcb: Basal crop coefficient
:PPT: Precipitation
:Irrigation:  Irrigation
:Runoff:  Runoff
:DPerc: Deep Percolation from the root zone
:P_rz:  Precipitation residing in the root zone

:NIWR:  Net Irrigation Water Requirement
:Season:  Growing Season Flag (1 = True, 0 = False)
:Cutting: Cutting Flag (applies to crops that harvested via cutting cycles (e.g. alfalfa))
  
Monthly, annual, and growing season statistics are aggregated from the daily output files according to the statistics in the list below:

:PMeto/PMetr:    sum
:ETact:          sum
:ETpot:          sum
:ETbas:          sum
