The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a product of the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) with the mission “to provide timely, accurate and useful statistics in service to U.S. agriculture”
(`Boryan et al 2011 <https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2011.562309>`_). The CDL is a crop-specific land cover classification product of more than 100 crop categories grown in the United States developed using remote sensing. 
The CDL can be downloaded from NASS’s `CropScape <https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/>`_ tool.
