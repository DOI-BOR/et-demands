The ET-Demands model...

Acknowledgements
----------------
The basis for the ET Demands model is the dual crop coefficient method
presented in FAO-56 `(Allen et al., 1998) <https://www.kimberly.uidaho.edu/water/fao56/fao56.pdf>`_.
Original model code was developed by ...

Model History
-------------
This methods used in this model were used to evaluate evapotranspiration and
consumptive use irrigation water requirements for the state of Idaho
`(Allen and Robison, 2007) <http://data.kimberly.uidaho.edu/ETIdaho/ETIdaho_Report_April_2007_with_supplement.pdf>`_
and the state of Nevada `(Huntington and Allen, 2010) <https://www.dri.edu/images/stories/divisions/dhs/dhsfaculty/Justin-Huntington/Huntington_and_Allen_2010.pdf>`_. This approach has been used to quantify historical and future irrigation water requirements for selected irrigation projects operated by the Bureau of Reclamation `(Reclamation, 2016) <https://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/baseline/docs/historicalandfutureirrigationwaterrequirements.pdf>`_. This approach has also been used to quantify historical and future irrigation water requirements in support of Reclamation's
WaterSMART `Basin Studies Program <https://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/bsp/>`_.
